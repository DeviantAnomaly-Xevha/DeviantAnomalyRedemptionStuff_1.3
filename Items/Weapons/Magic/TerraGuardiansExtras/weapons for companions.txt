The Xenomite Crystal Bomb weapon's image consists of 15 frames in a 32x480 image.

Michelle and the others must be trying to wield that entire image size... so I made these simpler versions for them.

Also, companions don't try to charge weapons, not even the Charged Blaster Cannon, so these are non-charging and auto-firing.
